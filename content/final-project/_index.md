# Final Project -- Analyzing European Soccer 

## Introduction
We investigated data from European professional soccer leagues between 2007 and 2016.  

## Data Acquisition
We obtained our data as csv files from Kaggle from the [European Soccer Database](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hugomathien/soccer). We also incorporated data from Kaggle's [supplemental database](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jiezi2004/soccer). The data includes data about players' attributes (e.g. height, weight, age) and match results between European teams in each league.
